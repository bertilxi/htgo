# Next Steps for HTGO

This document outlines recommended next improvements and how to continue enhancing HTGO's UX and DX.

---

## Current Status

✅ **Complete:** UX/DX improvements across 3 phases
- Phase 1: Developer feedback (startup messages, dynamic WebSocket, better errors)
- Phase 2: CLI tool (htgo new, dev, build commands)
- Phase 3: Build improvements (validation, progress, error context)

**Impact:** HTGO is now production-ready with professional developer experience

---

## Phase 4: Advanced Developer Tools (Recommended Next)

### 4.1 Configuration Validation (`htgo validate`)

**Problem:** Users might misconfigure HTGO without realizing it until they run dev server

**Solution:** Add validation command that checks configuration before runtime

```bash
htgo validate
# Output:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ Project validation complete
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ All page files found (5 pages)
✓ All routes are unique
✓ No circular dependencies detected
⚠️  4 pages with potential prop issues (see below)

📄 Routes:
   GET  /               pages/index.tsx         ✓
   GET  /about          pages/about.tsx         ✓
   GET  /blog           pages/blog.tsx          ⚠️  (see warnings)
   GET  /blog/:id       pages/blog/[id].tsx     ✓
   GET  /admin          pages/admin.tsx         ⚠️  (needs auth)

Warnings:
  • /blog might have unmappable props
  • /admin has complex prop structure
  • Consider simplifying prop shapes
```

**Implementation Effort:** Medium (2-3 hours)
**Value:** High - Catches config issues early

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Add `validate` command to CLI
- [ ] Create validation utilities
- [ ] Check all page files
- [ ] Validate routes (no duplicates, valid paths)
- [ ] Check props serializability
- [ ] Generate detailed report

---

### 4.2 Component Scaffolding (`htgo generate`)

**Problem:** Users have to create page files manually and copy boilerplate

**Solution:** Generate components with templates

```bash
htgo generate page about
# Creates: pages/about.tsx with boilerplate

htgo generate page blog/:id
# Creates: pages/blog/[id].tsx with route params handling

htgo generate page admin --template form
# Creates: pages/admin.tsx with form template
```

**Implementation Effort:** Medium (3-4 hours)
**Value:** High - Accelerates development

**Features to add:**
- [ ] Basic page template
- [ ] Parameterized page template (blog/:id)
- [ ] Form page template
- [ ] List page template
- [ ] Admin page template

---

### 4.3 Better Error Messages for Common Mistakes

**Problem:** Some errors are still cryptic (import errors, missing dependencies, etc.)

**Solution:** Add specific error handling for common mistakes

```
Scenario: User imports module not installed
Current:  "Cannot find module 'lodash'"
Better:   "Module not found: 'lodash'
           Did you mean to run: npm install lodash"

Scenario: User creates page with wrong export
Current:  "renderPage is not a function"
Better:   "Invalid component export in pages/about.tsx
           Page components must export default React component
           Example: export default function About() { ... }"
```

**Implementation Effort:** Low (1-2 hours)
**Value:** Medium - Reduces friction

---

## Phase 5: Documentation & Getting Started

### 5.1 Improved README

Current README is minimal (24 lines). Should expand to:

```markdown
# HTGO - React SSR for Go

## Quick Start
htgo new my-app

## Features
- Automatic Server-Side Rendering
- Hot-reload Development
- Tailwind CSS Built-in
- ...

## Getting Help
- [Tutorial](docs/tutorial.md)
- [API Reference](docs/api.md)
- [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md)
- [Examples](examples/)
```

**Implementation Effort:** Medium (2-3 hours)
**Value:** High - Helps new users

---

### 5.2 Tutorial & Guides

Create documentation:
- `docs/getting-started.md` - First project walkthrough
- `docs/architecture.md` - How HTGO works
- `docs/api-reference.md` - All configuration options
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions
- `docs/deployment.md` - How to deploy
- `docs/examples.md` - Recipe collection

**Implementation Effort:** High (4-6 hours)
**Value:** Very High - Critical for adoption

---

### 5.3 Interactive Tutorial

Similar to how other modern tools (Create React App, Next.js) guide users

```bash
htgo new --interactive
# Walks user through options
# Creates customized starter project
```

**Implementation Effort:** High (4-5 hours)
**Value:** Medium - Nice to have

---

## Phase 6: Performance & Production

### 6.1 Bundle Size Analysis

```bash
htgo analyze
# Shows:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Bundle Analysis
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Total bundle size: 245 KB (62 KB gzipped)

Per page breakdown:
  /              45 KB (12 KB gz)  - React, utils, hooks
  /about         28 KB (8 KB gz)   - Small component
  /blog          67 KB (16 KB gz)  - Large list + filters
  /blog/:id      38 KB (10 KB gz)  - Article reader

Opportunities:
  • /blog could save 15 KB with code splitting
  • Consider lazy loading filters
  • lodash is 20 KB, try lodash-es instead
```

**Implementation Effort:** High (4-5 hours)
**Value:** Medium - Helps optimization

---

### 6.2 Performance Profiling

```bash
htgo profile
# Shows render times, bundle stats, recommendations
```

**Implementation Effort:** High (5-6 hours)
**Value:** Medium - Helps optimization

---

## Quick Wins to Do Now

These can be done very quickly and have immediate value:

### 1. Better Error Message for Missing npm Dependency

**Current:** "Cannot find module 'react'"
**Better:** "Module 'react' not found. Run: npm install react"
**Time:** 20 minutes

### 2. Show Environment Info in `htgo version`

```bash
$ htgo version
htgo 0.1.0
Go 1.23.5
Node 20.10.0
Platform: linux/x86_64
```

**Time:** 20 minutes

### 3. Add `htgo docs` Command

Opens documentation in browser

```bash
htgo docs            # Opens index
htgo docs tutorial   # Opens tutorial
htgo docs api        # Opens API reference
```

**Time:** 30 minutes

### 4. Improve Project Scaffolding

Add more examples to generated pages:
- Add comment explaining hydration
- Add example props structure
- Add TypeScript types for Page props

**Time:** 30 minutes

---

## Communication Strategy

Once these improvements are complete, consider:

1. **Write a blog post** about HTGO improvements
2. **Create demo video** showing the workflow
3. **Share on communities** (r/golang, HackerNews, etc.)
4. **Ask for feedback** from early users
5. **Iterate based on feedback**

---

## Measurement

Track these metrics after improvements:
- Time for new user to get first app running
- Number of build failures for new users
- Frequency of "how do I..." questions
- GitHub stars/community growth
- User satisfaction (if you can survey)

---

## Questions to Consider

Before next phase, think about:

1. **What are users struggling with most?**
   - Track GitHub issues and feedback
   - Monitor questions in communities

2. **What would have the most impact?**
   - Better documentation?
   - Better error messages?
   - More examples?
   - Better tooling?

3. **What's unique about HTGO?**
   - What makes it different from Next.js?
   - What makes it different from other Go frameworks?
   - How to emphasize those strengths?

4. **Who is the target user?**
   - Go developers new to React?
   - React developers learning Go?
   - Full-stack developers?
   - This affects messaging and examples

---

## Resources for Inspiration

Look at how these frameworks present themselves for ideas:

- **Next.js** - Excellent docs and tutorial
- **Create React App** - Simple one-command setup
- **Remix** - Great error messages
- **Astro** - Beautiful marketing and examples

---

## Conclusion

HTGO has transformed significantly from Phase 1-3. The next phase should focus on:
1. **Documentation** - Help users succeed
2. **Validation** - Catch errors early
3. **Feedback** - Continue listening to users

With these improvements, HTGO will be not just technically sound, but also a pleasure to use.
